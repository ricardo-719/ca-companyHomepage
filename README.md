# Challenge Project: Company Home Page

This is a challenge project as part of Codecademy's Full Stack Web Developer Path.

In this project, I’ll be using flexbox and/or grid to design and build the layout for a company’s homepage.

The **requirements** for the Project are:

- A title and logo or splash image.
- A mission statement or brief description of the company.
- A list or set of images and titles representing the product or products of the company.
- A section describing some of the company’s employees or teammates.

The project must **use flexbox and/or grid** tools such as:

- Create a centered navbar at the top of the page.
- Create a flexible display of company products that changes from a more grid-like list to a column list as the page shrinks.
- Create a flexible display of company employees.

The project must also use **custom styles** for other properties, such as colors, fonts, and other layout properties such as borders and padding. For example:

- A simple color scheme using CSS named colors, but yours can be more elaborate with hexadecimal, RGB, or HSL colors.
- Fonts from the Google Fonts API.
- Custom images. A great source for project images when you’re practicing web design is Unsplash.
